  bio: I tend to spread out in my interests in the very wide umbrella of ocean color, where I’ve spent several months at sea, characterized phytoplankton photophysiology, and developed bio-optical models. Currently, I’m very excited about uncertainty and all the information it contains!

    - Hydrosol optical properties 
    - polarization
    - bio-optical algorithms
