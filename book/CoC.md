# Event Code of Conduct

Guidelines to ensure we offer a hospitable and inclusive event and a list of resources for reporting violations. Although the content is similar, this event Code of Conduct should not be confused with the {{ '[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct]({url}/{repo}/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)'.format(url=github_org_url, repo=book_repo) }}  governing contributions to this JupyterBook.

## Overview

The organizers of this event are dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age or religion.
We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any event venues in either in-person or virtual form, including the Slack workspace. Participants (including event volunteers and organizers) violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the PACE Hackweek at the discretion of the organizers.

## Definition of Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion.
* Sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Harassing photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Expectations

We expect participants and instructors to act in ways that foster a supportive and welcoming learning community at all event venues and event-related social activities. We expect you to support collaboration and learning while participating in this community of practice. Hackweek organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants (including unintentionally). Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to comply may result in the participant being expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.

## Reporting a violation
Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of the event for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible.
