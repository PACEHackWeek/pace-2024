📖 On this JupyterBook website you'll find [lectures](presentations/lectures) and [tutorials](presentations/tutorials). Lectures provide science updates on all things PACE. Tutorials can include slides and Jupyter Notebooks, designed to be run interactively, but also rendered on this website for convenience.

👩‍💻 During a Hackweek teams work collaboratively on different projects. Read more about the projects and results on our [projects page](projects/list_of_projects)
