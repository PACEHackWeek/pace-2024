# List of Projects

Hackweek participants started hashing out project ideas on Day 1, self-formed into groups of 2-6, and
got to work. By Day 5, each group was ready to present early discoveries from their first glimpses at
PACE data products. Several groups with code repositories decided to share their work from the start,
taking the "share-early" approach to open science.
