# List of Projects

The IDs and descriptions below are a starting point for developing projects to carry out over
our {{dates}} {{ hackweek }} hackweek. The list will shrink (or grow!) and the descriptions
will change. We are excited to find out what you'll do!

|1  | develop regionally tuned total suspended solids algorithm using OCI and GLORIA dataset    |
|2  | synthesize OCI oxygen-A band and MAP products for coastal atmospheric correction           |
|3  | use in-situ CDOM, DOC, Rrs data to explore using spectral slopes in UV for DOC estimation  |
|4  | explore microplastic algorithm from combined IOPs and DoLP                                 |
|5  | compare hyperspectral Kd algorithms to hyperspectral floats                                |
|6  | compare fluorescence derived chl-a from floats to OCI estimates                            |
|7  | compare PCC, or some stand-in like AVW, in and around eddies mapped by SWOT                |
|8  | follow water mass IOPs over time from tracking of long-lived eddies                        |
|9  | validate chl-a using in-situ observations from Chesapeake Bay and relate to know SAV beds  |

|14 | phytoplankton biomass variation with environmental factors in Lake Erie                    |
|15 | relate biome boundaries defined from physical variables and chl-a to any metric of PCC     |
|16 | use in-situ PCC data to train algorithm with hyperspectral Rrs inputs to differentiate PCC |
|17 | multi-angle polarimetry comparison to vertical profiles from airborne campaigns            |
|18 | extreme event signatures in chl-a and aerosol data in coastal waters of Brazil             |
|19 | associate freshwater OC to costal OC, possibly merging OCI with Landsat/Sentinel           |
|20 | hunt for accessory pigments (chl-d, chl-f) and phytoplankton functional types from space   |
